        <p><strong>Do you consider yourself more of a designer or developer (or something else, other answers are acceptable)?</strong><br>
        <i>I consider myself more in line of development rather than the designing field.</i></p>
        
        <p><strong>What are you most interested in learning in this class?</strong><br>
        <i>I would like to learn more on photoshop since I lack experience with the program and to get used to using commits from Github when keeping track of project changes.</i>
        
        <p><strong>What is good design?</strong><br>
        <i>A good design is simplicity, nothing too drastic, a lot of whitespace and easy on the eyes.</i>
        
        <p><strong>What is good web design?</strong><br>
        <i> I like a lot of white space, nuetral scheme and having your content that you want the audience to focus on be at the center (fixed)              so it's easier for the audience to see exactly want you want them to.</i>
        </i>
        
        <p><strong>What are the good examples of conference/event web sites? Answer by listing at least two sites including each URL and why you chose              the site.</strong><br>

                <i>What I love about the layout is the fact that the color scheme are not too blinding towards the eye.  You have the schedule on the left column and the content on the middle/right side of the page.  Nothing too fancy, just simple and easy to follow.  A very simple navigation bar on the top as well.</i>

                <i>What I love about the layout is that the center of the navigation shows the name of the section you've clicked/scrolled throughout the page.  It is still somewhat simple though it has a bit more graphics. The content is in a beehive design but it meshes well with the boldness of the color scheme.  It's not really all over the place, the content is still focused on the middle of the web browser.  Each section has a different color scheme but keeps the layout pretty much within the same design (images within the beehive/pentagon shapes, image within the shape and text elibile to read)  Also the letter spacing helps make the text easier to read.</i>
